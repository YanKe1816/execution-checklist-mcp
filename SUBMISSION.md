This app converts policy / requirement text into a structured execution checklist.

It does not provide compliance judgments, pass/fail decisions, or risk assessments.
It only translates text into clear, actionable steps with verification fields.

The app exposes a single MCP tool (generate_checklist) that returns a deterministic JSON checklist for agent execution.
